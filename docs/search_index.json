During this period people’s lives and health received impact and socio-economic deterioration. Therefore, it is particularly important to quickly and effectively address this infectious disease that affects all of humanity and minimizes negative economic impacts. This report will focus on some key issues regarding the epidemic and epidemic prevention policies. For example, trends in the epidemic, state epidemic control policies in the United States, and how epidemic control policies can mitigate the spread of the epidemic and reduce infection data. The remainder of this report will be developed from the following perspectives: the second section of the report is Proposal, which will introduce the research topic and Data availability. the third section of the report is Data, which will introduce the sources of data, the basic data processing methods and the data processing results. The fourth section of the report is Results, where some pictures will be used to show whether the outbreak prevention and control policies have alleviated the severity of the outbreak. The fifth part is the Interactive component, where the implementation of some policies, such as whether or not states are pursuing mandatory vaccine and mandatory quarantine policies, will be used to show different graphs. Finally, the report will summarize some basic conclusions. "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic 2.2 Data availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic This report will focus on the development of the outbreak, the implementation of outbreak prevention and control policies in each U.S. state, and the effectiveness of outbreak prevention and control policies. In the course of the analysis, different graphs will be put together for comparison, providing evidence of the effectiveness of vaccines and other epidemic prevention policies. The hope of this paper is to find those tools that can significantly improve the spread of COVID-19. This may be of slightly less use for viruses whose current virulence has diminished, but it does have significant implications for policy implementation and for future public health events that may be encountered. 2.2 Data availability Data for the report will be obtained from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) at the URL https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home. The dataset selected for the report is from the CDC’s COVID Data Tracker. Several data files were considered for the analysis and visualization of the report. The first is Case, Death, &amp; Laboratory Testing Trends by Location, a data file that monitors the rise and fall of COVID-19 cases, deaths, testing volume and percent positivity, nationally and by state. The temporal frequency of the data is weekly. The report will also show Case &amp; Death Trends by Demographics, a data file that counts trends in case and death data by gender, race, and other disaggregated methods. In this dataset, interaction methods will be appropriately applied to demonstrate category characteristics. Next is Vaccination Distribution &amp; Coverage. this dataset contains the distribution of Vaccinations with weekly frequency. This dataset is able to provide variation in the number of vaccines by state. When the number of Vaccinations increases, it somewhat reflects the importance of COVID-19 to the state government. Finally, the report uses Social Impact &amp; Prevention, a dataExplore the social impacts of COVID-19 and see how human movement and COVID-19 prevention measures correspond to trends in the pandemic. It was released by the state government at the time the policy was issued. In the report, this will be shown in the same graph as the number of cases and deaths, reacting to the impact of the policy on the prevention and control of the epidemic. Also, interactive methods will be used to differentiate the performance of different states. In general, the report focuses on the following elements by presenting chronological charts, comparative charts with the inclusion of interactive features. First is the change in the number of cases, deaths and tests, and graphs of these data will provide detailed characteristics of the various stages of the outbreak. Next, the distribution of vaccines by state and vaccine coverage is shown on a map of the entire U.S. This provides a snapshot of how different states are approaching the outbreak. Another key piece of data is prophylaxis, which compares state outbreaks with prophylaxis data to show whether vaccination policies are having the desired effect. Also, the interactive approach will show the different measures and policy strengths of different states in the face of an outbreak.

Also, the geographic data for the visualization of states across the United States will be based on some R packages, which are implemented by calling functions, as described in the following sections. The data source home page presents data from the following sections: 1. Case, Death, &amp; Laboratory Testing Trends by Location. 2. Case &amp; Death Trends by Demographics. 3.

This report expects to analyze trends in the development of the epidemic and present this result through a time series plot. Then, by analyzing the vaccine coverage and the implementation of epidemic prevention policies in each state, effective measures to mitigate the epidemic will be sought. Therefore, the target dataset will include COVID-19 cases, DEATHS, vaccine distribution by state and anti-epidemic policies implemented by state, etc. However, some of the datasets do not have significant analytical utility for the target questions, such as health equity, pediatric and prevalence data, and are therefore not considered in this report. The main variables in the Vaccine dataset include date, the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), location, number of delivered doses, number of administered doses based on the jurisdiction, vaccination status, and booster vaccination status.

Therefore, directly eliminating these variables from the dataset helps to reduce the computational process as well as the cognitive burden. The variables that are relevant to the subject matter of the report and the content of the study, as well as the proportional variables that can be used as comparisons between states, were mainly retained. Then, the number of variables and observations obtained is as follows. Data Variables.Number Observation.Number Vaccine 7 36888 Policy 5 451771 Cases 8 8880 3.3 Missing value analysis Since the original dataset is long format, this means that most of observations are valid data and only Additional_Doses_Vax_Pct have missing observations with proportion of 88.10453%. A graph on the percentage of missing values in the dataset can prove this. x Date 0.0000000 MMWR_week 0.0000000 Location 0.0000000 Dist_Per_100K 0.0000000 Admin_Per_100K 0.0000000 Series_Complete_Pop_Pct 0.0000000 Additional_Doses_Vax_Pct 0.8810453 x Data.Source 0 Policy.Name 0 Day.of.Date 0 Policy.Value 0 State.Name 0 x state 0 end_date 0 tot_cases 0 new_cases 0 tot_deaths 0 new_deaths 0 new_historic_cases 0 new_historic_deaths 0 But this does not mean that the data is complete, because when the data set is converted to wide format or merged with other data sets, some missing values on the date will appear. For a more subsequent and convenient analysis, the three datasets need to be merged into a combined dataset. The merge process needs to retain all possible missing values for the analysis below. The merged missing data are as follows. x Date 0.0000000 State 0.0018142 MMWR_week 33.0793513 Dist_Per_100K 33.0793513 Admin_Per_100K 33.0793513 Series_Complete_Pop_Pct 33.0793513 Additional_Doses_Vax_Pct 33.6689525 Policy.Value.Stay at Home Orders 39.2728856 Policy.Value.Gathering Bans 44.2418635 Policy.Value.Bar Closures 59.0635318 Policy.Value.Restrictions on internal movement 65.7505170 Policy.Value.School closing 55.1993759 Policy.Value.Cancel public events 47.6053119 Policy.Value.Close public transport 47.7196038 Policy.Value.Mask Mandates 40.5917782 Policy.Value.General Closures 34.1769167 Policy.Value.Restaurant Closures 55.7653931 Policy.Value.International travel controls 40.4539023 Policy.Value.Public information campaigns 32.0543522 Policy.Value.Workplace closing 55.0488008 tot_cases 83.8902797 new_cases 83.8902797 tot_deaths 83.8902797 new_deaths 83.8902797 new_historic_cases 83.8902797 new_historic_deaths 83.8902797 Of these, the missing values are larger for cases data, smaller for vaccine data, and medium for policy data. This may be due to the fact that vaccine data are updated more frequently, while case data are updated more slowly. Since policies are continuous, the last updated policy can be used as a proxy for the missing interval. Then the missing values reduce a lot for policy data. x Date 0.0000000 State 0.0018142 MMWR_week 33.0793513 Dist_Per_100K 33.0793513 Admin_Per_100K 33.0793513 Series_Complete_Pop_Pct 33.0793513 Additional_Doses_Vax_Pct 33.6689525 Policy.Value.Stay at Home Orders 16.5469323 Policy.Value.Gathering Bans 16.5469323 Policy.Value.Bar Closures 16.5469323 Policy.Value.Restrictions on internal movement 16.5469323 Policy.Value.School closing 16.5469323 Policy.Value.Cancel public events 16.5469323 Policy.Value.Close public transport 16.5469323 Policy.Value.Mask Mandates 16.5469323 Policy.Value.General Closures 16.5469323 Policy.Value.Restaurant Closures 16.5469323 Policy.Value.International travel controls 16.5469323 Policy.Value.Public information campaigns 16.5469323 Policy.Value.Workplace closing 16.5469323 tot_cases 83.8902797 new_cases 83.8902797 tot_deaths 83.8902797 new_deaths 83.8902797 new_historic_cases 83.8902797 new_historic_deaths 83.8902797 Finally, remove missing observations from the dataset, here mainly short some missing policies and most of the cases data that are in the update interval. At this point, the analysis and processing process of the missing data is completed. "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results 4.1 COVID-19 Trend Analysis 4.2 Vaccine Status Analysis 4.3 Policy Analysis", " Chapter 4 Results 4.1 COVID-19 Trend Analysis First, observe the general development of COVID-19 in the United States. The sum of data on cases was calculated for each state by date classification, and these data included new, cumulative, and historical cumulative data. The graphs of total cases and total deaths demonstrate a number of characteristics. First, total Cases increases at the beginning of 2021 and shows a substantial increase at the beginning of 2022, which raises the question whether the increase in Cases is due to seasonal factors or to policy easing. Next, a graph of total deaths over time is drawn. Total Deaths show the same upward trend at the beginning of 2021 and the beginning of 2022. Then, the graphs of new cases and new deaths are plotted, and the number of new cases can reflect the changes over time more visually. 2021 starts with more new cases, and then the number of new cases gradually decreases. At the beginning of 2022, the number of new cases reaches a very high peak, and then declines again. New deaths are highest at the beginning of 2021 and then reach a low in July 2021. new deaths rise again in late 2021 and early 2022, and then fall again to a low. 4.2 Vaccine Status Analysis The vaccine DISTRIBUTION is plotted separately at the end of the last three years (December 30, 2020, December 29, 2021, and November 16, 2022). This is shown in the US map and is expressed as distribution per 100 thousand to eliminate scale effects. The results show essentially no vaccine distribution at the end of 2020. there is a fair amount of distribution across the US at the end of 2021, with slightly more vaccines (darker colors) in the East and West. By 2022, the distribution of vaccines is more pronounced, mainly in the northern part of the United States, especially in the Northeast and Northwest. Similarly, data on the percentage of the population with vaccine series complete are plotted in the map of the U.S. At the end of 2020, there is no vaccine offered for vaccination. at the end of 2021, the series vaccination rate for states in the eastern, western, and south-central U.S. is already over 50%. By the end of 2022, most states have more than 50% vaccination coverage. To explore whether the vaccine is effective in reducing the severity of the epidemic, the report chose one of the states, Califonia (CA), to draw graphs of change of vaccine distribution, change of vaccination complete rates, change of additional vaccination rates, new cases, and new deaths. and keeping the same timeline. The time series plot set shows that both new cases and new DEATHs decline significantly in 2021 as VACCINE series complete and VACCINE distribution rise. However, the epidemic rebounded sharply again in late 2021 to early 2022, even with the emergence of ADDITIONAL DOSE. Subsequently, additional dose rises again and the epidemic growth rate slows down. This suggests that while vaccine can improve the epidemic, the determinants of the epidemic may lie elsewhere, such as policy. 4.3 Policy Analysis First, the presentation of policy data. Each policy and the possible values to be taken are shown below. Stay.at.Home.Orders Recommend not leaving house Advisory/Recommendation Require not leaving house with exceptions for daily exercise, grocery shopping, and ‘essential’ trips Mandatory - all people No order found No measures No data Gathering.Bans Restrictions on gatherings of 10 people or less Bans gatherings of any size Ban of gatherings over 1-10 people Restrictions on gatherings between 11-100 people No order found Ban of gatherings over 25-50 people No restrictions No data School.closing Require closing all levels Require closing (only some levels or categories, eg just high school, or just public schools) Recommend closing or all schools open with alterations resulting in significant differences compared to non-COVID-19 operations No measures No data Cancel.public.events Require cancelling Recommend cancelling No measures No data Close.public.transport No measures No data Mask.Mandates Required in all shared/public spaces outside the home with other people present or all situations when social distancing not possible Public Mask Mandate Required in some specified shared/public spaces outside the home with other people present, or some situations when social distancing not possible Required outside the home at all times regardless of location or presence of other people No Public Mask Mandate No data International.travel.controls No restrictions No data Clearly, each policy has a different intensity of implementation. The report will mainly analyze the most frequently discussed policies as a proxy for other policies. The selected policies include Gathering Bans and Mask Mandates. also, each policy is assigned a policy intensity in order of lightest to heaviest. This can quantify policy implementation efforts. \\[\\text{Policy Stringen}_i=\\frac{Rank_i}{Max(Rank_j)-Min(Rank_j)}\\] Using CA as an example, a time series plot of the intensity of implementation of the two policies versus additional cases and deaths is drawn. The following results illustrate that when Gathering Bans and Mask Mandates are relaxed, they cause a temporary bounce in new cases and deaths. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 5 Interactive component", " Chapter 5 Interactive component This section will show the trend of the total cases of different states over time. The interactive function is used here, which is implemented by combining D3 with Bookdown. A button to switch between states is provided in the upper left corner of the figure above The horizontal coordinate of the graph is the number of days until the initial day of data, and the vertical coordinate is the total number of people. By switching states, it is possible to display multi-dimensional data. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 6 Conclusion", " Chapter 6 Conclusion This report analyzes COVID-19 trends in the United States, comparing vaccine coverage and policy implementation, and provides some insights into the COVID-19 process and mitigation approaches. First, some key data on COVID-19 in the U.S. were obtained, which included data on cases and deaths by state, with weekly time frequency, as well as vaccine and policy data. The vaccine data include state and date dimensions, including vaccine distribution, series vaccine complete proportion, and additional dose proportion. policy data include state, policy release date, policy name, and The policy data include state, policy release date, policy name, and policy content. For ease of analysis, the report selects some of the variables in the above dataset. The report analyzes the target problem through visualization. First, a time series plot of cases and deaths is presented, which includes both the number of additions and the total number. The time series graphs show that there is an explosive trend in COVID-19 in both early 2021 and early 2022, and the trend is huge in early 2022. Next, a map of the United States is used to show the distribution and vaccination of the vaccine. The images show that the northeastern and northwestern United States have the highest vaccine coverage rates. This may be related to economic development, but could not be verified in this stuy. Next, Califonia was chosen as an example to compare the impact of vaccine versus additional dose coverage and policy implementation on COVID-19, respectively. The images illustrate that increasing the proportion of vaccination and improving vaccine distribution can effectively reduce the infection rate and the number of new deaths. However, in the face of policy relaxation, even ADDITIONAL DOSE could not reverse the trend of massive COVID-19 outbreaks. In other words, policy factors are still the main determinants of outbreak development. There are still many areas of improvement in this paper. For example, COVID-19 may reflect some information from an economic and political perspective. Are those states with high vaccination rates also more economically developed? Or do states with stricter outbreak control measures imply a different political direction, such as more Democratic or Republican-held states? Of course, all of this requires more data, and these data need to be collected through multiple sources. In the end, this report provides valid information for policy making and epidemic control. For example, the government should implement a strong containment policy at the beginning of the outbreak and accelerate resource investment and vaccine development. As vaccination rates increase, the policy should be gradually relaxed, but not too quickly. Finally, full relaxation of controls should be considered when virus virulence declines and when vaccines are fully available.
