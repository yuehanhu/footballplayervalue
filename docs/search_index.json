Through certain visualization and statistical learning methods, the influencing factors of players’ professional judgment are explored, and the interesting patterns between players’ personal information and annual reactions are driven from data. Questions: Q1: Explore the factors that affect player Value through a variety of data visualization methods. Q2: Through a variety of data visualization methods, explore the factors that affect the player’s Wage, which factors have a significant impact on the player’s Wage, and make a comparative analysis with the factors that affect the player’s Value. 2.2 Data availability There are a lot of datasets on kaggle webside, we together chose the Football (FIFA - 2019) dataset.

This Dataset Contains all Information of players who participated in the FIFA-2019 League and consists of all the parameters, which a Player’s ability can be measured some of the parameters included in the dataset. Our project will explore the factors that affect player Value and Wage through data visualization methods. The dataset includes 18,207 rows, 89 columns, and mainly includes the following fields. This Dataset consists of 89 Features including the parameters, by which a Player’s ability can be measured some of the parameters included in the dataset are, Age, Skill Moves, Work Rate, Body Type, joined year, Agility. This data set is large and can be used for data cleaning, data transformation, missing value processing, and data visualization, to explore the factors that affect Football Players’ Value and Wage, and to explore the factors affecting Football Players’ Value and Wage in a multi-dimensional way. factors to explore which factors have a significant impact on Football Players’ Value and Wage.
