# Proposal:

2.1 Research topic

In today's professional football market, how to quantify the professional skills of players, and whether their annual performance can be predicted based on the players' information will directly affect our judgment of their commercial value. Through certain visualization and statistical learning methods, the influencing factors of players' professional judgment are explored, and the interesting patterns between players' personal information and annual reactions are driven from data. 

Questions:

Q1: Explore the factors that affect player Value through a variety of data visualization methods.

Q2: Through a variety of data visualization methods, explore the factors that affect the player's Wage, which factors have a significant impact on the player's Wage, and make a comparative analysis with the factors that affect the player's Value.

2.2 Data availability
